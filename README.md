# ü¶Ñ CF Workers: easy-utils
*A library designed to make writing workers so much cleaner and easier!*

Welcome to easy-utils, this library is designed to make writing Workers easy as heck. Included in this package is a bunch of helpers for responses, profiling*, handling cookies, and serving any static assets.

Turn your Worker code from spaghetti hell to majestic artwork today with easy-utils.

**Documentation**:
## https://easy-utils.docs.ceru.dev

## üîß Install
`npm i cfw-easy-utils` 

## ‚ú® Examples

### üî® No more JSON.stringify!
Stuck having to copy paste the same 4 lines of code just to return a simple JSON object? Now you can easily return any JSON-compatible object/array without having to worry about your code getting complex.
```js
return response.json({ 'hello': 'world!' })
```

### üé® Cache S3 buckets & more!
Want to save money on your bill? Cache your assets on the edge and speed up your images. No more having to Google for hours trying to get a solution to work.
```js
return response.static(request, { baseUrl: 'https://yourbucket.net' })
```

### üçÉ Handle CORS with a breeze!
CORS can be so cumbersome and annoying. Let easy-utils handle it for you so you can focus on your Worker's real purpose.
```js
if (request.method == 'OPTIONS') {
    return response.cors()
}

// autoCors is true by default, but we want to show it off.
return response.json({ hello: 'World' }, { autoCors: true })
```

### ‚è± Time your I/O to reduce slowdowns.
Record your times to watch for any slow I/O events. Will only count I/O as Workers cannot count CPU time internally. All you need to do is mark some times, then set the Stopwatch option on *any* of easy-utils response handler and it will set the `Server-Timing` header for you. Look in the `Timing` header of your modern browser to view the timings.
```js
import { Stopwatch } from 'cfw-easy-utils'

const watch = new Stopwatch()
const value = await KVNAMESPACE.get('somekey')
watch.mark('Got KV response')
return response.json({ kv: value }, { stopwatch: watch })
```

### üòÑ Generate user accounts on the edge
Want to take your user experience to the next level? You can generate password hashes and UUID's direct in your Worker.
```js
import { response, secrets } from 'cfw-easy-utils'

// Later, use secrets.verifyPassword to verify someone's identity.
return response.json({
    id: secrets.uuidv4(),
    passwordHash: await secrets.hashPassword('passw0rd01')
})
```

### ü¶Ñ This is only some of the examples of what you can do with cfw-easy-utils.
